This project is about developing a chatbot for  enhancing the MS bais business process using chatgpt based chatbot and Lang chain Model. 

Brief Overview
This Project report describes how developing and deploying a Custom
chatbot that meets the unique requirements of Answering the Muma
College of Business's Business Analytics and Information Systems
(BAIS) curriculum-related questions by utilizing specialized data sources
available on the internet and the OpenAI API will reduce the Work load
on the MS BAIS program's Graduate Coordinator.
This chatbot is trained to answer a wide range of questions about courses,
programs, admissions, and general help. It was created in response to the
increasing need for effective and timely student support. The chatbot can
ensure that students receive correct and relevant information by engaging
in meaningful and context-aware interactions with them, leveraging
OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities.
The utilization of custom data sources related to the BAIS program and
stored in Pinecone data base further enhances the chatbot's ability to
address program-specific questions. By consolidating the knowledge
required to navigate the intricacies of the BAIS program, this chatbot not
only lightens the workload of the Graduate Coordinator but also ensures
students' immediate access to the information they need.
To enable the chatbot to comprehend and successfully react to student
requests, we have used Python technology and its packages, And a major
integration between OpenAI's API , Pinecone and Stream-lit.
In conclusion, by providing prompt and dependable answers to student
inquiries, this chatbot proves to be a useful resource at Muma College of
Business, especially for the Graduate Coordinator of the MS BAIS
program. It increases student happiness and overall program efficiency by
streamlining communication and improving student assistance.
